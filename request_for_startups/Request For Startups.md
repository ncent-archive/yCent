### 1. jobCent
#### Problem
The labor market is disjointed-- job seekers have trouble finding the right openings, and organizations have difficulty with identifying the right candidates. The state of the labor market today is such that we rely on external resources (headhunters, recruiting firms, etc.) to insert themselves into networks of people to find matches between candidates and available positions. What if we could tap into these networks without the need for any sort of external facilitator?

#### Why JobCent
jobCent is the nCent Labs protocol for finding and placing candidates within our own organization via the incentivization of referral networks. jobCent is designed specifically to recursively incentivize people to refer the most qualified candidates in their network. Everyone in the referral chain gets credit for a new hire, solving the value attribution problem that prevents existing networks from contributing to faster and higher quality job placements. 

#### Existing Institutions We Want to Disrupt
Angellist, Linkedin, Headhunting Agencies

#### Examples

### 2. bugCent
#### Problem
As a consumer, you observe the bugs in the products you use every day. However, there is a disconnect between consumers and companies. Often times, there is not enough incentive for consumers to report their suggestions or observed bugs to companies. What if we could connect consumers to companies in a mutually beneficial and incentivized manner to increase the feedback pool?

#### Why bugCent
bugCent is the nCent Labs protocol for reporting bugs in products or services to companies. bugCent is designed specifically to recursively incentivize people to refer the most relevant people in their network to report bugs for a company. Everyone in the referral chain gets credit for a reported bug, solving the value attribution problem that prevents existing networks from contributing to feedback pools in order for companies to improve their services.

#### Existing Institutions We Want to Disrupt
Bug Bounty Applications

#### Examples

### 3. legacyCent
#### Problem
Solving medical problems requires research and information. There is a dearth of data when it comes to cancer research. The missing link in most of our efforts to find a cure lies in the data. Privacy concerns have thwarted researchers' access to cancer patients' data. 

#### Why legacyCent
legacyCent is the nCent Labs protocol for collecting cancer patients' data via the incentivization of referral networks. legacyCent is designed specifically to recursively incentivize people to refer other patients willing to share their data in their network. Everyone in the referral chain gets points for a new patient who pledges to share their data and makes their mark in the fight against cancer, solving the value attribution problem that prevents existing networks from contributing to greater collection of data. 

#### Examples

### 4. LearnCent
#### Problem
Education is an industry with so much value, yet it is constantly held back by inefficiencies in current institutions and systems. Students have such a variety of different learning styles, yet we do not have the resources or tools to match them effectively with teachers, mentors or tutors. Imagine the potential we could unlock in people if we simply were able to maximize their ability to learn.

#### Why LearnCent?
LearnCent is an innovative take on peer-to-peer tutoring using the nCent Sandbox and SDK! This contribution came from our first ever [hackCent competition](https://ncent.io/Applications/hackCent/hackCent.html). View the implementation below.

#### Examples

### 5. SportCent
#### Problem
Contrary to popular belief, sports teams are not only trying to win games - they are also businesses focused on sustaining profits each season. Professional sports teams are one of the unique business types that can utilize strong brand loyalty among their fan bases. This potential for virality gives way to the emergence of incentive markets!

#### Why SportCent?
SportCent gives professional sports teams and their fan bases an opportunity to share merchandise sales revenue. Other ideas we have for SportCent include attendance and viewership referral systems. These will allow sports teams to become far more popular by incentivizing referrals at a small cost to their sales revenue.

#### Existing Institutions We Want to Disrupt
Ticketing, Merchandise Sales, etc.

#### Examples

### 6. DateCent
#### Problem
Finding partners and meeting new people can be a daunting endeavor for today's singles. Many have turned to applications that either leverage algorithms or simply ask the user to filter nearby matches. What if, instead of trying to rely on programmatic matchmakers, we had a tool to more easily leverage our own networks? Too often we hear success stories come from people being "set up" by their friends, indicating there may be an underutilization of networks in today's world. DateCent provides incentives for referral of romantic partners to allow the search for romantic partners to become as efficient and effective as possible.

#### Why DateCent will Disrupt the Dating World
Many modern applications use algorithms or require users to apply broad categorical filters to locate romantic partners. These methods of finding romantic partners are inefficient due to their inability to dive deeply enough into their own users to effectively match them. Instead, DateCent targets the user's network, providing incentives to those who refer matches efficiently and effectively.

#### Existing Institutions We Want to Disrupt
Applications that use algorithms like Match.com or apply broad categorical or user-initiated filters such as Tinder to locate romantic partners.

### 7. SongCent
#### Problem
With the recent surge of music streaming and the newest trends in revenue sharing, musicians depend more than ever on popularity to be successful in their careers. Right now, popularity is determined in the music industry by certain long-standing means of exposure such as the radio, advertisements, and more. Social media has turned out to have a huge role in the sharing of music between fans, but there are still many potential "shares" to be had for aspiring artists looking for their work to go viral.

#### Why SongCent
Free applications such as SoundCloud have demonstrated how hungry artists are just to get exposure to their music, but while a platform for aspiring artists is great, there is still a piece missing in the way of fanbase accumulation. SongCent is an ambitious project that aims to redefine the concept of royalties in its entirety. Rather than all profits for each "listen" of a song going to record labels and streaming services (with a small share going to the artists themselves), SongCent aims to attribute value to the fans responsible for giving a platform to the artists they love by rewarding them for successfully sharing music with other prospective fans via successful listens to shared content.

#### Existing Institutions we want to Disrupt
Record Labels, Streaming Services and other Music Delivery Institutions, Music Sharing Applications such as Spotify, Pandora, etc.

#### Examples

### 8. FanCent
#### Problem
Building a fanbase is one of the more difficult aspects of any performance-based profession. Similar to sportCent, we see huge potential in the idea of tapping into the virality of loyal fans by incentivizing them to help build the fanbases for the artists they love!

#### Why FanCent
FanCent is the nCent Labs incentive application that incentivizes artists to find and engage existing and prospective fans. By utilizing fan networks artists could have a much easier time building their fanbases.

#### Examples

### 9. GameCent
#### Problem
Gaming is trending further toward multiplayer every year, especially with the rise of games like Fortnite. Unfortunately, games like these can be discouraging for potential fans who have a harder time âpartying upâ.

#### Why GameCent
GameCent solves those problems by aiming to incentivize multiplayer gaming. Referring your friends for bonus points, loot, and "XP" is not a new concept, but GameCent is looking to take it to the next level. Hard to coordinate with new people you just met alone? GameCent can incentive teamwork by aligning team rewards.    

#### Existing Institutions we are looking to Disrupt
Xbox Live, Playstation Network, Steam, and more
